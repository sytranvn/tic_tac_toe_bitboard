Tic-Tac-Toe Alpha Beta pruning

## Alpha-Beta pruning 

[Alphaâ€“beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning).

## Minimax

If current position is wins or lose to a player. Return `inf/-inf` accordingly.

Otherwise, try all possible moves from center of the board. If AI can win with
a move, take that move immediately. If in 4 moves, we find a way for human to
win, we have to block it. Therefore we have to check terminal state with 4
level deep. If we ensure we will not lose in 4 moves, use `heuristic`
function to consider next move.

## Heuristic evaluation

Find all possible wins from current position by assuming we will occupy the
remaining empty cells. From those winning states, count how many cell we had
set.

Do the same for opponent and subtract to get heuristic value.


## Game state optimization

Instead of using 2D list. We use single list as rows of the board and manage
column using bitwise operators. We can use single number and go full bitwise
but with 9x9 board, it will be 81 bits. Even though python can expand variable
bits for us. I just don't like it.

# Windows

Windows user must install `windows-curses`.

Clicking is supported but might not work properly on Windows . And I
don't care.
